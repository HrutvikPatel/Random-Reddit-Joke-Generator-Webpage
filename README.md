# Reddit Jokes
Simple web page that uses backend Python (flask for the Rest Api created) and frontend JS, HTML and CSS to post random reddit jokes from a data file.

Could not upload the data file. I got the data file form kaggle, it is provided by the user: PenPen. You can search "reddit /r/Jokes" for the page where you can download the file from.
